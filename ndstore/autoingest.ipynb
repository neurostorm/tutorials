    "As we've mentioned in previous tutorials, there are several methods for ingesting ones' data into **ndstore**. Which one to choose depends on the size and organization of the data, as well as where it is located. In our case, data is located on a public, HTTP accessible server, so we can exploit one of the easiest forms of ingesting - autoingest. This service requires installing the **ndio** package and running a python script which contains your image location and properties of your dataset/project/token/channel in **ndstore**."
